	OOC: Your goal here is to capture people to fatten up. Avoid intentionally killing and causing chaos on the station if you can at all help it. <br>\
	Before capturing someone, be sure to check their preferences and make sure that they are not already occupied. A discord message or LOOC never hurts if you aren't sure. OOC communication is very important. <br>\
	You have the power to send people back to the station, make sure that you talk with them before sending them back. Especially if they are someone that wasn't on the station in the first place, like a Den Victim. \
	<br>\
	It is heavily advised that you find a target before you teleport onto the station as some crew members are not good canidates.<br>\
	With the camera console you have access to the entire camera network of the station, use this to your advantage to formulate a plan. \
	<br><br>\
	Right before heading onto the station, make sure that you grab a science tool and sync it with the feeder console. \
	Syncing it will allow you to beam both yourself and captives back to the den. \
	To do this, mark the person you want to mark by touching them with the tool. Once someone is marked you can use the tool on them again to beam them up.<br>\
	Additionally, if you have someone to help you, they can beam up anyone that is marked, by using the camera console.\
	<br><br>\
	Credits can be gained by having someone you fattened up use the tracking scale. Keep in mind that credits can only be gained when someone surpasses their previous max weight.\
	Additionally, you are only able to get 9000 credits from a person.\
	<br><br>\
	You are able to use the console and pad to send victims back to the station after you are done with them. Avoid sending them anywhere dangerous or obvious unless you want to risk the ire of GATO. "

				<h3>Drinks for Growing Guts</h3>

				Been a bartender for Gato quite a while now. In my time here, I've taken notice of how certain mixes produced...
				Certain effects, that the same mixtures don't produce elsewhere. I'm writing down my findings here.

				<ol>
				<li><b>Belly Bloats:</b> equal parts gibb floats and beer. Really bulks up a belly. Some folks got real bloated with air after drinking this one.</li>
				<li><b>Blobby Mary:</b> equal parts tomato juice, vodka and lipoifier. If you want to get back at some rich folks, this is your drink.</li>
				<li><b>Heavy Cafe:</b> equal parts latte, either cafe or soy, sugar and cream. One hell of a bomb to start a shift with.</li>
				<li><b>Fruits Tea:</b> equal parts berry juice, lemon juice and tea. Even teetotal folks aren't safe from growing. Some folks become... Real sloshy. Note: I once mixed it with blueberry juice from a vendor. Be ready to juice if you do too.</li>
				<li><b>Snakebite:</b> equal parts toxins, lime juice and lipoifier. Feels like a snake biting your throat when it goes down. Sure "paralyzes" like some real snake bites.</li>
				<li><b>Beltbuster Mead:</b> equal parts mead, ethanol, cream and lipoifier. Very alcoholic and immensely fattening. Clothes won't hold after this one.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
				Remember, this stuff is quite something. Don't serve these to folks that don't want it.

				<h3>The Strange Chems of GATO-Controlled Sectors</h3>

				Peculiar reactions not found anywhere else taken within the sector of GATO's control, especially within the station of GS13.
				To ensure that the knowledge isn't lost to time, I've decided some of the simpler reactions here.

				<ol>
				<li><b>Lipoifier:</b> The opposite of Lipolicide. Seems to multiply fat cells in one's body. Equal parts corn oil, sugar and synthflesh.</li>
				<li><b>Fizulphite:</b> Seems to stir up a strange reaction in stomachs, making them all bubbly. 1u of nitrogen, 1u sugar and 3u of oxygen.</li>
				<li><b>Extilphite:</b> Very useful chem! Helps soothe stomach bloat and relieves fullness. 1u sugar, 2u hydrogen, 2u carbon.</li>
				<li><b>Flatulose:</b> This chemical is similar to Fizulphite, but results in uncontrolled release of rear gasses. 1u sugar, 1u of Bad Food, 1u of Cream.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
				Remember to be responsible with those chems. They aren't lethal or toxic, but they can be undesired by locals.
